Why we need a bot to automate it?
It is more reliable than your shaky hands during the last few seconds before bid ends. People are selling more advanced version for thousands of dollars.

Does it work?
It works as expected but the feautres are really limited compared with other bots. But this one is free:)

What it supports:
1) Supports all options from offcial bidding page
2) Automatically execute bidding strategy, e.g "Add 600 on top of current target price at 11:29:45 and execute the bid at 11:29:57"

How to use it:

1) Make sure the official bidding page is clearly present on the screen with no other window over it
2) run python main.py
3) follow the menu options

Good luck!
